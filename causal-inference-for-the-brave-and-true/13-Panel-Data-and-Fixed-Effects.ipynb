    "## Controlling What you Cannot See\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods like propensity score, linear regression and matching are very good at controlling for confounding in non-random data, but they rely on a key assumption: conditional unconfoundedness\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "(Y_0, Y_1) \\perp T | X\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it in words, they require that all the confounders are known and measured, so that we can condition on them and make the treatment as good as random. One major issue with this is that sometimes we simply can't measure a confounder. For instance, take a classical labor economics problem of figuring out the impact of marriage on men's earnings. It's a well known fact in Economics that married men earn more than single men. What is not as clear is if this relationship is causal or not. It could be that more educated people are both more likely to marry and more likely to have a high earnings job, which would mean that education is a confounder of the effect of marriage on earnings. For this confounder, we could measure the education of the person in the study and run a regression controlling for that. But another confounder could be beauty. It could be that more handsome men are both more likely to get married and more likely to have a high paying job. Unfortunately, beauty is one of those characteristics like intelligence. It's something we can't measure very well.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This puts us in a difficult situation, because if we have unmeasured confounders, we have bias. One way to deal with this is with instrumental variables, like we've seen before. But coming up with good instruments it's no easy task and requires a lot of creativity. Here, let's look at an alternative that takes advantage of time or the temporal structure of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to use **panel data**. Panel data is when we have **observations on the same individual for multiple periods of time**. Panel data formats are very common in the industry, where they keep records of customer behavior for the same customer and for multiple time periods. The reason we can leverage panel data is because we can compare the same unit before and after the treatment and see how they behave with it. Before we dive in the math, let's see how this makes intuitive sense."

    "First, let's take a look at the causal graph that we have once we include multiple observations of the same unit across time. Suppose we have a situation where marriage at the first time causes income at the same time and subsequent marital status. This is also true for times 2 and 3. Also, suppose that beauty is the same across all time periods (a bold statement, but reasonable if time is just a few years) and it causes both marriage and income."

    "Think about it. We can't measure attributes like beauty and intelligence, but we know that the person who has them is the same individual across time. So, we can create a dummy variable indicating that person and add that to a linear model. This is what we mean when we say we can control for the person itself: we are adding a variable (dummy in this case) that denotes that particular person. When estimating the effect of marriage on income with this person dummy in our model, regression finds the effect of marriage **while keeping the person variable fixed**. Adding this entity dummy is what we call a fixed effect model.\n",

In addition to this, we have other controls, like number of hours worked that year, years of education and so on."

Suppose you work for a big tech company and you want to estimate the impact of a billboard marketing campaign on in-app purchase. When you look at data from the past, you see that the marketing department tends to spend more to place billboards on cities where the purchase level is lower. This makes sense right? They wouldn't need to do lots of advertisement if sales were skyrocketing. If you run a regression model on this data, it looks like higher cost in marketing leads to less in-app purchase, but only because marketing investments is biased towards low spending regions. "

    "Take a minute to appreciate what the image above is telling you about what fixed effect is doing. Notice that fixed effect is fitting **one regression line per city**. Also notice that the lines are parallel. The slope of the line is the effect of marketing costs on in-app purchase. So the **fixed effect is assuming that the causal effect is constants across all entities**, which are cities in this case. This can be a weakness or an advantage, depending on how you see it. It is a weakness if you are interested in finding the causal effect per city. Since the FE model assumes this effect is constant across entities, you won't find any difference in the causal effect. However, if you want to find the overall impact of marketing on in-app purchase, the panel structure of the data is a very useful leverage that fixed effects can explore. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we did a fixed effect for the individual level, we could design a fixed effect for the time level. If adding a dummy for each individual controls for fixed individual characteristics, adding a time dummy would control for variables that are fixed across time. One example of such a variable is inflation. Prices and salary tend to go up with time. If the wage and marriage proportion also changes with time, we would have time as a confounder. To give a more concrete example, suppose that marriage is increasing with time. Since inflation also makes salary increase with time, some of the positive association we see between marriage and wage would be simply because both are increasing with time. To correct for that, we can add a dummy variable for each time period. In `linear models`, this is as simple as adding `TimeEffects` to our formula and setting the `cluster_time` to true."

    "\n",
    "Using panel data and fixed effects models is an extremely powerful tool for causal inference. When you don't have random data nor good instruments, the fixed effect is as convincing as it gets for causal inference with non experimental data. Still, it is worth mentioning that it is not a panacea. There are situations where even panel data won't help you.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious one is when you have confounders that are changing in time. Fixed effects can only eliminate bias from attributes that are constant for each individual. For instance, suppose that you can increase your intelligence level by reading books and eating lots of good fats. This causes you to get a higher paying job and a wife. Fixed effect won't be able to remove this bias due to unmeasured intelligence confounding because, in this example, intelligence is changing in time. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img](./data/img/fixed-effects/time-travel.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Another less obvious case when fixed effect fails is when you have **reversed causality**. For instance, let's say that it isn't marriage that causes you to earn more. Is earning more that increases your chances of getting married. In this case, it will appear that they have a positive correlation but earnings come first. They would change in time and in the same direction, so fixed effects wouldn't be able to control for that. \n",

    "Here, we saw how to use panel data, data where we have multiple measurements of the same individuals across multiple time periods. When that is the case, we can use a fixed effect model that controls for the entity, holding all individual, time constant attributes, fixed. This is a powerful and very convincing way of controlling for confounding and it is as good as it gets with non random data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we saw that FE is not a panacea. We saw two situations where it doesn't work: when we have reverse causality and when the unmeasured confounding is changing in time.\n",

    "I like to think of this entire book as a tribute to Joshua Angrist, Alberto Abadie and Christopher Walters for their amazing Econometrics class. Most of the ideas here are taken from their classes at the American Economic Association. Watching them is what is keeping me sane during this tough year of 2020.\n",
