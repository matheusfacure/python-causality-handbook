    "As we've seen so far, regression does an amazing job at controlling for additional variables when we do a test vs control comparison. If we have independence, $(Y_0, Y_1)\\perp T | X$, then regression can identify the ATE by controlling for X. The way regression does this is kind of magical. To get some intuition about it, let's remember the case when all variables X are dummy variables. If that is the case, regression partitions the data into the dummy cells and computes the mean difference between test and control. This difference in means keeps the Xs constant, since we are doing it in a fixed cell of X dummy. It is as if we were doing $E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0] | X=x$, where $x$ is a dummy cell (all dummies set to 1, for example).  Regression then combines the estimate in each of the cells to produce a final ATE. The way it does this is by applying weights to the cell proportional to the variance of the treatment on that group.

On men, the true causal effect is -3, so the drug lowers the stay period by 3 days. On women, it is -2. To make matters more interesting, men are much more affected by this illness and stay longer at the hospital. They also get much more of the drug. Only 1 out of the 6 men does not get the drug. On the other hand, women are more resistant to this illness, so they stay less at the hospital. 50% of the women get the drug."

If we had exactly the same number of men and women in the data, the ATE estimate would be right in the middle of the ATE of the 2 groups, -2.5. Since there are more men than women in our dataset, the ATE estimate is a little bit closer to the men's ATE.

So far, so good. However, when it comes to combining the effect on each group, it does not weigh them just by the sample size. Instead, regression uses weights that are also proportional to the variance of the treatment in that group. In our case, the variance of the treatment in men is smaller than in women, since only one man is in the control group. To be exact, the variance of T for men is $0.139=1/6*(1 - 1/6)$ and for women is $0.25=2/4*(1 - 2/4)$. So regression will give a higher weight to women in our example and the ATE will be a bit closer to the women's ATE of -2."

Let's use matching on age to try to correct that. We will take unit 1 from the treated and pair it with unit 27, since both are 28 years old. Unit 2 we will pair it with unit 34, unit 3 with unit 37, unit 4 we will pair it with unit 35... When it comes to unit 5, we need to find someone with age 29 from the non treated, but that is unit 37, which is already paired. This is not a problem, since we can use the same unit multiple times.

    "But this was a very contrived example, just to introduce matching. In reality, we usually have more than one feature and units don't match perfectly. In this case, we have to define some measurement of proximity to compare how units are close to each other. One common metric for this is the euclidean norm $||X_i - X_j||$. This difference, however, is not invariant to the scale of the features. This means that features like age, that take values on the tenths, will be much less important when computing this norm compared to features like income, which take the order of hundreds. For this reason, before applying the norm, we need to scale the features so that they are on roughly the same scale.\n",

    "$\n",

    "where $N_1$ is the number of treated individuals and $Y_j(i)$ is the untreated match of treated unit i. To check for bias, what we do is hope we can apply the Central Limit Theorem so that this down there converges to a normal distribution with mean zero. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\sqrt{N_1}(\\hat{ATET} - ATET)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this doesn't alway happen. If we define the mean outcome for the untreated given X, $\\mu_0(x)=E[Y|X=x, T=0]$, we will have that (btw, I've omitted the proof for that because it's a little beyond the point here).\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",

    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, $\\mu_0(X_i) - \\mu_0(X_j(i))$ is not so simple to understand, so let's look at it more carefully. $\\mu_0(X_i)$ is the outcome Y value of a treated unit $i$ had it not been treated. So, it is the counterfactual outcome $Y_0$ for unit i. $\\mu_0(X_j(i))$ is the outcome of the untreated unit $j$ that is the match of unit $i$. So, it is also the $Y_0$ , but for unit $j$ now. Only this time, it is a factual outcome, because $j$ is in the non treated group. Now, because $j$ and $i$ are only similar, but not the same, this will likely not be zero. In other words, $X_i \\approx X_j $. So, $Y_{0i} \\approx Y_{0j} $. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we increase the sample size, there will be more units to match, so the difference between unit $i$ and its match $j$ will also get smaller. But this difference converges to zero slowly. As a result $E[\\sqrt{N_1}(\\mu_0(X_i) - \\mu_0(X_j(i)))]$ may not converge to zero, because the $\\sqrt{N_1}$ grows faster than $(\\mu_0(X_i) - \\mu_0(X_j(i)))$ diminishes.\n",

    "Bias arises when the matching discrepancies are huge. Fortunately, we know how to correct it. Each observation contributes $(\\mu_0(X_i) - \\mu_0(X_j(i)))$ to the bias so all we need to do is subtract this quantity from each matching comparison in our estimator. To do so, we can replace $\\mu_0(X_j(i))$ with some sort of estimate of this quantity $\\hat{\\mu_0}(X_j(i))$, which can be obtained with models like linear regression. This updates the ATET estimator to the following equation\n",

Linear regression here is local, in the sense that it doesn't try to see how the treated would be if it looked like the untreated. It does none of that extrapolation. This is left to the matching part. The meat of the estimator is still the matching component. The point I want to make here is that OLS is secondary to this estimator. \n",

For example, Abadie spent a lot of time studying and developing the estimator (yes, he is one of the scientists that contributes to matching being what it is), so he obviously is personally invested in the method. Second, there is something about linear regression's simplicity that you don't see in matching. The partial derivative math of \"holding everything else constant\" is much easier to grasp with linear regression than with matching. But that's just my preference. To be honest, there is no clear answer to this question. Anyway, back to our example.\n",

In more general terms, the more features we have, the higher will be the distance between units and their matches. \n",

Early on, in that contrived medicine example where with man and woman, it was quite easy to build the subclassification estimator. That was because we only had 2 cells: man and woman. But what would happen if we had more? Let's say we have 2 continuous features like age and income and we manage to discretise them into 5 buckets each. This will give us 25 cells, or $5^2$. And what if we had 10 covariates with 3 buckets each? Doesn't seem like a lot right? Well, this would give us 59049 cells, or $3^{10}$. It's easy to see how this can blow out of proportion pretty quickly. This is a phenomena pervasive in all data science, which is called the **The Curse of Dimensionality**!!!\n",

So, if it takes X data points to fill the space of, say, 3 feature spaces, it takes exponentially more points to fill in the space of 4 features. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the subclassification estimator, the curse of dimensionality means that it will suffer if we have lots of features. Lots of features imply multiple cells in X. If there are multiple cells, some of them will have very few data. Some of them might even have only treated or only control, so it won't be possible to estimate the ATE there, which would break our estimator. In the matching context, this means that the feature space will be very sparse and units will be very far from each other. This will increase the distance between matches and cause bias problems. \n",

    "As for linear regression, it actually handles this problem quite well. What it does is project all the features X into a single one, the Y dimension. It then makes treatment and control comparison on that projection. So, in some way, linear regression performs some sort of dimensionality reduction to estimate the ATE. It's quite elegant. \n",

    "Most causal models also have some way to deal with the curse of dimensionality. I won't keep repeating myself, but it is something you should keep in mind when looking at them. For instance, when we deal with propensity scores in the following section, try to see how it solves this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "We've started this section understanding what linear regression does and how it can help us identify causal relationships. Namely, we understood that regression can be seen as partitioning the dataset into cells, computing the ATE in each cell and then combining the cell's ATE into a single ATE for the entire dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "From there, we've derived a very general causal inference estimator with subclassification. We saw how that estimator is not very useful in practice but it gave us some interesting insights on how to tackle the problem of causal inference estimation. That gave us the opportunity to talk about the matching estimator. \n",
    "\n",
    "Matching controls for the confounders by looking at each treated unit and finding an untreated pair that is very similar to it and similarly for the untreated units. We saw how to implement this method using the KNN algorithm and also how to debiase it using regression. Finally, we discussed the difference between matching and linear regression. We saw how matching is a non parametric estimator that doesn't rely on linearity the way linear regression does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we've delved into the problem of high dimensional datasets and we saw how causal inference methods can suffer from it.\n",
