    "So far, we've seen how to debias our data in the case where the treatment is not randomly assigned, which results in confounding bias. That helps us with the identification problem in causal inference. In other words, once the units are exchangeable, or $ Y(0), Y(1) \\perp X$, it becomes possible to learn the treatment effect. But we are far from done. \n",
    " \n",
    "Identification means that we can find the average treatment effect. In other words, we know how effective a treatment is on average. Of course this is useful, as it helps us to decide if we should roll out a treatment or not. But we want more than that. We want to know if there are subgroups of units that respond better or worse to the treatment. That should allow for a much better policy, one where we only treat the ones that will benefit from it.\n",

    "## Problem Setup\n",

    "Let's recall our setup of interest. Given the potential outcomes, we can define the individual treatment effect as the difference between the potential outcomes.\n",

    "$\n",
    "\\tau_i = Y_i(1) − Y_i(0),\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "or, the continuous treatment case, $\\tau_i = \\partial Y(t)$, where $t$ is the treatment variable. Of course, we can never observe the individual treatment effect, because we only get to see the one of potential outcomes\n",
    " \n",
    "$\n",
    "Y^{obs}_i(t)= \n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "Y_i(1), & \\text{if } t=1\\\\\n",
    "Y_i(0), & \\text{if } t=0\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "We can define the average treatment effect (ATE) as\n",

    "\\tau = E[Y_i(1) − Y_i(0)] = E[\\tau_i]\n",
    "$\n",

    "and the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as\n",
    " \n",
    "$\n",
    "\\tau(x) = E[Y_i(1) − Y_i(0)|X] = E[\\tau_i|X]\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "In Part I of this book, we've focused mostly on the ATE. Now, we are interested in the CATE. The CATE is useful for personalising a decision making process. For example, if you have a drug as the treatment $t$, you want to know which type of patients are more responsive to the drug (higher CATE) and if there are some types of patient with a negative response (CATE < 0). \n",
    " \n",
    "We've seen how to estimate the CATE using a linear regression with interactions between the treatment and the features\n",
    " \n",

    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "Still, the linear models have some drawbacks. The main one being the linearity assumption on $X$. Notice that you don't even care about $\\beta_2$ on this model. But if the features $X$ don't have a linear relationship with the outcome, your estimates of the causal parameters $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_3$ will be off. \n",
    " \n",

    " \n",
    "Suppose your treatment is binary. Let's say you are an investment firm testing the effectiveness of sending a financial education email. You hope the email will make people invest more. Also, let's say you did a randomized study where 50% of the customers got the email and the other 50% didn't. \n",

    "So, if the unit was treated, you would take the outcome and multiply it by 2. If it wasn't treated, you would take the outcome and multiply it by -2. For example, if one of your customers invested BRL 2000,00 and got the email, the transformed target would be 4000. However, if he or she didn't get the email, it would be -4000. \n",
    " \n",
    "This seems very odd, because you are saying that the effect of the email can be a negative number, but bare with me. If we do a little bit of math, we can see that, on average or in expectation, this transformed target will be the treatment effect. This is nothing short of amazing. What I'm saying is that by applying this somewhat wacky transformation, I get to estimate something that I can't even observe. \n",
    " \n",
    "To understand that, we need a bit of math. Because of random assignment, we have that $T \\perp Y(1), Y(1)$, which is our old unconfoundedness friend. That implies that $E[T, Y(t)]=E[T]*E[Y(t)]$, which is the definition of independence.\n",

As it turns out, the answer is a bit more complicated, but not much. First, if we don't have random assignment, we need at least conditional independence $T \\perp Y(1), Y(1) | X$. That is, controlling for $X$, $T$ is as good as random. With that, we can generalize the transformed target to\n",

    "That is actually one of the biggest downsides of this target transformation technique. With this target transformation, you do get a lot of simplicity, since you can just transform the target and use any ML estimator to predict heterogeneous treatment effects. The cost of it is that you get a lot of variance. That's because the transformed target is a very noisy estimate of the individual treatment effect and that variance gets transferred to your estimation. This is a huge problem if you don't have a lot of data, but it should be less of a problem in big data applications, where you are dealing with more than 1MM samples."

    "Another obvious downside of the target transformation method is that it only works for discrete or binary treatments. This is something you see a lot in the causal inference literature. Most of the research is done for the binary treatment case, but you don't find a lot about continuous treatments. That bothered me a lot, because in the industry, continuous treatments are everywhere, mostly in the form of prices you need to optimize. So, even though I couldn't find anything regarding target transformations for continuous treatment, I came up with something that works in practice. Just keep in mind that I don't have a super solid econometric research around it.\n",
    " \n",
    "To motivate it, let's go back to the ice cream sales example. There, we were tasked with the problem of estimating demand elasticity to price so that we can better set the ice cream prices to optimize our revenues. Recall that the event sample in the dataset is a day and we wish to know when people are less sensitive to price increases. Also, recall that prices are randomly assigned in this dataset, which means we don't need to worry about confounding bias."

    "For this data, it looks like the model with transformed target is way better than random. Not only that, train and test results are pretty close, so variance is not an issue here. But this is just a characteristic of this dataset. If you recall, this was not the case when we explored the binary treatment case. There, the model performed not so great. \n",
    " \n",
    "### Non Linear Treatment Effects\n",
    " \n",
    "Having talked about the continuous case, there is still an elephant in the room we need to adress. We've assumed a linearity on the treatment effect. However, that is very rarely a reasonable assumption. Usually, treatment effects saturate in one form or another. In our example, it's reasonable to think that demand will go down faster at the first units of price increase, but then it will fall slowlier.\n",
    " \n",
    "![img](./data/img/plug-and-play-estimators/non-linear-case.png)\n",
    " \n",
    "The problem here is that **elasticity or treatment effect changes with the treatment itself**. In our example, the treatment effect is more intense at the beginning of the curve and smaller as prices get higher. Again,suppose you have two types of days: hot days (yellow) and cold days (blue) and we want to distinguish between the two with a causal model. The thing is that causal models should predict elasticity, but in the nonlinear case, the elasticity for hot and cold days could be the same, if we look at different price points in the curve (right image).\n",
    " \n",
    "There is no easy way out of this problem and I confess I'm still investigating what works best. For now, the thing that I do is try to think about the functional form of the treatment effect and somehow linearize it. For example, demand usually has the following functional form, where higher $\\alpha$s means that demand falls faster with each price increase\n",
    " \n",
    "$\n",
    "D_i = \\dfrac{1}{P_i^{\\alpha}}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if I apply the log transformation to both the demand $Y$ and prices $T$, I should get something that is linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "log(D)_i &= log\\bigg(\\dfrac{1}{P_i^{\\alpha}}\\bigg) \\\\\n",
    "&= log(1) - log(P_i^{\\alpha}) \\\\\n",
    "&= log(1) - log(P_i^{\\alpha}) \\\\\n",
    "&= - \\alpha * log(P_i) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "$\n",
    " \n",
    "Linearization is not so easy to do, as it involves some thinking. But you can also try stuff out and see what works best. Often, things like logs and square roots help.\n",
    " \n",
    "## Key Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now moving in the direction of estimating conditional average treatment effects using machine learning models. The biggest challenge when doing so is adapting a predictive model to one that estimates causal effects. Another way of thinking about it is that predictive models focus on estimating the outcome Y as a function of features X and possibly treatment T $Y = M(X, T) $ while causal models need to estimate the partial derivative of this output function on the treatment $ \\partial Y = \\partial M(X, T) $. This is far from trivial, because while we do observe the outcome Y, we can't observe $\\partial Y$, at least not on an individual level. As a consequence, we need to be creative when designing an objective function for our models. \n",
    " \n",
    "Here, we saw a very simple technique of target transformation. The idea is to combine the original target Y with the treatment T to form a transformed target which is, in expectation, equal to the CATE. With that new target, we can plug any predictive ML model to estimate it and then the model predictions will be CATE estimates. As a side note, besides target transformation, this method also goes by the name of **F-Learner**. \n",
    " \n",
    "With all that simplicity, there is also a price to pay. The transformed target is a very noisy estimate of the individual treatment effect and that noise will be transferred to the model estimates in the form of variance. This makes target transformation better suited for big data applications, where variance is less of a problem due to sheer sample sizes. Another downside of the target transformation method is that it is only defined for binary or categorical treatments. We did our best to come up with a continuous version of the approach and even ended up with something that seemed to work, but up until now, there is no solid theoretical framework to back it up. \n",
    " \n",
    "Finally, we've ended with a discussion on non linear treatment effects and the challenges that come with it. Namely, when the treatment effect changes with the treatment itself, we might mistakenly think units have the same treatment response curve because they have the same responsiveness to the treatment, but actually they are just receiving different treatment amounts. \n",

    "The things I've written here are mostly stuff from my head. I've learned them through experience. This means that they have **not** passed the academic scrutiny that good science often goes through. Instead, notice how I'm talking about things that work in practice, but I don't spend too much time explaining why that is the case. It's a sort of science from the streets, if you will.

    "Most of this chapter draws from Susan Atheys' and Guido W. Imbens' paper, *Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effects*. Some material about target transformation can also be found on Pierre Gutierrez' and Jean-Yves G´erardy's paper, *Causal Inference and Uplift Modeling: A review of the literature*. Note that these papers only cover the binary treatment case. Another review of causal models for CATE estimation that references the F-Learner is *Meta-learners for Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects using Machine Learning*, by K¨unzel et al, 2019. \n",
