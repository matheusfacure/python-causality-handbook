    "When dealing with causal inference, we saw how there are two potential outcomes for each individual: $Y_0$ is the outcome the individual would have if he or she didn't take the treatment and $Y_1$ is the outcome if he or she took the treatment. The act of setting the treatment $T$ to 0 or 1 materializes one of the potential outcomes and makes it impossible for us to ever know the other one. This leads to the fact that the individual treatment effect $\\tau_i = Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}$ is unknowable. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "Y_i = Y_{0i} + T_i(Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}) = Y_{0i}(1-T_i) + T_i Y_{1i}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for now, let's focus on the simpler task of estimating the average causal effect. With this in mind, we are accepting the fact that some people respond better than others to the treatment, but we are also accepting that we can't know who they are. Instead, we will just try to see if the treatment works, **on average**. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "ATE = E[Y_1 - Y_0]\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us a simplified model, with a constant treatment effect $Y_{1i} = Y_{0i} + \\kappa$. If $\\kappa$ is positive, we will say that the treatment has, on average, a positive effect. Even if some people will respond badly to it, on average, the impact will be positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also recall that we can't simply estimate $E[Y_1 - Y_0]$ with the difference in mean $E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0]$ due to bias. Bias often arises when the treated and untreated are different for reasons other than the treatment itself. One way to see this is on how they differ in the potential outcome $Y_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "E[Y|T=1] - E[Y|T=0] = \\underbrace{E[Y_1 - Y_0|T=1]}_{ATET} + \\underbrace{\\{ E[Y_0|T=1] - E[Y_0|T=0]\\}}_{BIAS}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we saw how we can eliminate bias with Random Experiments, or **Randomised Controlled Trial** (RCT) as they are sometimes called. RCT forces the treated and the untreated to be equal and that's why the bias vanishes. We also saw how to place uncertainty levels around our estimates for the treatment effect. Namely, we looked at the case of online versus face-to-face classrooms, where $T=0$ represent face-to-face lectures and $T=1$ represent online ones. Students were randomly assigned to one of those 2 types of lectures and then their performance on an exam was evaluated. We've built an A/B testing function that could compare both groups, provide the average treatment effect and even place a confidence interval around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it's time to see that we can do all of that with the workhorse of causal inference: **Linear Regression**! Think of it this way. If comparing treated and untreated means was an apple for dessert, linear regression would be cold and creamy tiramisu. Or if comparing treated and untreated is a sad and old loaf of white wonder bread, linear regression would be a crusty, soft crumb country loaf sourdough baked by Chad Robertson himself.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](./data/img/linear-regression/you_vs.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets see how this beauty works. In the code below, we want to run the exact same analysis of comparing online vs face-to-face classes. But instead of doing all that math of confidence intervals, we just run a regression. More specifically, we estimate the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "exam_i = \\beta_0 + \\kappa \\ Online_i + u_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we are modeling the exam outcome as a baseline $\\beta_0$ plus $\\kappa$ if the class is online.  Of course the exam result is driven by additional variables (like student's mood on the exam day, hours studied and so on). But we don't really care about understanding those relationships. So, instead, we use that $u_i$ term to represent everything else we don't care about. This is called the model error. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $Online$ is our treatment indication and hence, a dummy variable. It is zero when the treatment is face to face and 1 if it's online. With that in mind, we can see that linear regression will recover $E[Y|T=0] = \\beta_0$ and $E[Y|T=1] = \\beta_0 + \\kappa $. $\\kappa$ will be our ATE."

    "Of course, it is not because we can estimate this simple model that it's correct. Notice how I was carefully with my words saying it **predicts** wage from education. I never said that this prediction was causal. In fact, by now, you probably have very serious reasons to believe this model is biased. Since our data didn't come from a random experiment, we don't know if those that got more education are comparable to those who got less. Going even further, from our understanding of how the world works, we are very certain that they are not comparable. Namely, we can argue that those with more years of education probably have richer parents, and that the increase we are seeing in wages as we increase education is just a reflection of how the family wealth is associated with more years of education. Putting it in math terms, we think that $E[Y_0|T=0] < E[Y_0|T=1]$, that is, those with more education would have higher income anyway, even without so many years of education. If you are really grim about education, you can argue that it can even *reduce* wages by keeping people out of the workforce and lowering their experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in our data, we have access to lots of other variables. We can see the parents' education `meduc`, `feduc`, the `IQ` score for that person, the number of years of experience `exper` and the tenure of the person in his or her current company `tenure`. We even have some dummy variables for marriage and black ethnicity. "

    "## Omitted Variable or Confounding Bias\n",
    "\n",
    "The question that remains is: is this parameter we've estimated causal? Unfortunately, we can't say for sure. We can argue that the first simple model that regress wage on education probably isn't. It omits important variables that are correlated both with education and with wages. Without controlling for them, the estimated impact of education is also capturing the impact of those other variables that were not included in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand how this bias work, let's suppose the true model for how education affects wage looks a bit like this\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "Wage_i = \\alpha + \\kappa \\ Educ_i + A_i'\\beta + u_i\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "wage is affected by education, which is measured by the size of $\\kappa$ and by additional ability factors, denoted as the vector $A$. If we omit ability from our model, our estimate for $\\kappa$ will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\dfrac{Cov(Wage_i, Educ_i)}{Var(Educ_i)} = \\kappa + \\beta'\\delta_{Ability}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\delta_{A}$ is the vector of coefficients from the regression of $A$ on $Educ$\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point here is that it won't be exactly the $\\kappa$ that we want. Instead, it comes with this extra annoying term $\\beta'\\delta_{A}$. This term is the impact of the omitted $A$ on $Wage$, $\\beta$ times the impact of the omitted on the included $Educ$. This is important for economists that Joshua Angrist made a mantra out of it so that the students can recite it in meditation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"Short equals long \n",
    "plus the effect of omitted \n",
    "times the regression of omitted on included\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the short regression is the one that omits variables, while the long is the one that includes them. This formula or mantra gives us further insight into the nature of bias. First, the bias term will be zero if the omitted variables have no impact on the dependent variable $Y$. This makes total sense. I don't need to control for stuff that is irrelevant for wages when trying to understand the impact of education on it (like how tall the lilies of the field). Second, the bias term will also be zero if the omitted variables have no impact on the treatment variable. This also makes intuitive sense. If everything that impacts education has been included in the model, there is no way the estimated impact of education is mixed with a correlation from education on something else that also impacts wages. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img](data/img/linear-regression/confused_cat.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it more succinctly, we say that **there is no OVB if all the confounding variables are accounted for in the model**. We can also leverage our knowledge about causal graphs here. A confounding variable is one that **causes both the treatment and the outcome**. In the wage example, IQ is a confounder. People with high IQ tend to complete more years of education because it's easier for them, so we can say that IQ causes education. People with high IQ also tend to be naturally more productive and consequently have higher wages, so IQ also causes wage. Since confounders are variables that affect both the treatment and the outcome, we mark them with an arrow going to T and Y. Here, I've denoted them with $W$. I've also marked positive causation with red and negative causation with blue."

    "Causal graphs are excellent to depict our understanding of the world and understand how confounding bias works. In our first example, we have a graph where education causes wage: more education leads to higher wages. However, IQ also causes wage and it also causes education: high IQ causes both more education and wage. If we don't account for IQ in our model, some of its effect on wage will flow through the correlation with education. That will make the impact of education look higher than it actually is. This is an example of positive bias.\n",

    "Just to give another example, but with negative bias, consider the causal graph about the effect of police on city violence. What we usually see in the world is that cities with higher police force also have more violence. Does this mean that the police are causing the violence? Well, it could be, I don't think it's worth getting into that discussion here. But, there is also a strong possibility that there is a confounding variable causing us to see a biased version of the impact of police on violence. It could be that increasing police force decreases violence. But, a third variable crime, causes both more violence and more police force. If we don't account for it, the impact of crime on violence will flow through police force, making it look like it increases violence. This is an example of negative bias.\n",

    "Now, back to our question, is the parameter we've estimated for the impact of `educ` on wage causal? I'm sorry to bring it to you, but that will depend on our ability to argue in favor or against that fact that all confounders have been included in the model. Personally, I think they haven't. For instance, we haven't included family wealth. Even if we included family education, that can only be seen as a proxy for wealth. We've also not accounted for factors like personal ambition. It could be that ambition is what causes both more years of education and higher wage, so it is a confounder. This is to show that **causal inference with non-random or observational data should always be taken with a grain of salt**. We can never be sure that all confounders were accounted for.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Ideas\n",
    "\n",
    "We've covered a lot of ground with regression. We saw how regression can be used to perform A/B testing and how it conveniently gives us confidence intervals. Then, we moved to study how regression solves a prediction problem and it is the best linear approximation to the conditional expectation function (CEF). We've also discussed how, in the bivariate case, the regression treatment coefficient is the covariance between the treatment and the outcome divided by the variance of the treatment. Expanding to the multivariate case, we figured out how regression gives us a partialling out interpretation of the treatment coefficient: it can be interpreted as how the outcome would change with the treatment while keeping all other included variables constant. This is what economists love to refer as *ceteris paribus*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we took a turn to understanding bias. We saw how `Short equals long plus the effect of omitted times the regression of omitted on included`. This shed some light to how bias comes to be. We discovered that the source of omitted variable bias is confounding: a variable that affects both the treatment and the outcome.
