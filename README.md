A light-hearted yet rigorous approach to learning impact estimation and sensitivity analysis. All in Python and with as many memes as I could find.

I like to think of this entire series as a tribute to Joshua Angrist, Alberto Abadie and Christopher Walters for their amazing Econometrics class. Most of the ideas here are taken from their classes at the American Economic Association. Watching them is what is keeping me sane during this tough year of 2020.

* [Mastering Mostly Harmless Econometrics](https://www.aeaweb.org/conference/cont-ed/2020-webcasts)

I'd also like to reference the amazing books from Angrist. They have shown me that Econometrics, or 'Metrics as they call it, is not only extremely useful but also profoundly fun.

Finally, I'd like to reference Miguel Hernan and Jamie Robins' book. It has been my trustworthy companion in the most thorny causal inference questions I've had to answer.

## How to Support This Work

Causal Inference for the Brave and True is an open-source resource primarily focused on econometrics and the statistics of science. It exclusively utilizes free software, grounded in Python. The primary objective is to ensure accessibility, not only from a financial standpoint but also from an intellectual perspective. I've tried my best to keep the content entertaining while maintaining the necessary scientific rigor.
